The goal of this project was to develop an app that could assist in automatic identification of the spotted lanterfly (and other pests) and to enable communication among users.

It was accomplished using AWS Cloud services.

This repo contains the source code for the app (for AWS Amplify) and the Jupyter Notebooks (for AWS Sagemaker) used for training the ML model for in automatic identification.
