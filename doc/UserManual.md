## User Guide For Grape Guard

### Getting Started
Grape Guard is an application designed for grape farmers to interact with to help them identify Spotted Lantern Flies and Grape Berry Moths on their vineyards. The concept of the application was brought about by Dr. Flor Acevedo, a professor in the College of Agriculture Sciences at Penn State Behrend. Dr. Flor is a part of a board of experts who have to handle helping farmers with identifying these invasive pests. In order to deal with the amount of time and quantity of requests, Dr. Flor is looking to implement some system or application that these farmers can use so that they can get an immediate answer to their questions without having to wait for an expert. 

Grape Guard implements an application that allows users to send images to be classified using a machine learning model trained to classify Spotted Lantern Flies and Grape Berry Moths. The application also includes additional features that users can use to obtain more information about these two pests and have conversations with other farmers who may be experiencing similar issues. Grape Guard was also designed to allow experts to use the information gathered by the application for research and analytical purposes. 

The rest of this section of documentation will walk through the various ascepts and features of Grape Guard and how they can be used.
