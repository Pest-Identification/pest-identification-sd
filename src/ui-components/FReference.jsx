        <a class="text-lg font-bold sm:text-xl md:text-2x1">Objectives And Needs</a>
        <p class="text-m text-black text-left">With the growing threat of infestation from both the Spotted Lanternfly and the Grape Berry
Moth Dr. Flor has reached out to us in the hopes of creating something that can lift some
of the burden off her and her colleagues’ shoulders. As of right now Dr. Flor is tasked with
replying to many growers of grapes within Erie and the surrounding areas concerns in regard to
possible infestations of their grape clusters and vineyards. There is often difficulty during these
communications to correctly and efficiently identify these pests whether on a grape cluster or
in the surrounding areas. This is because if a grower does not know what they are looking
for to identify the pest they often send in pictures that do not create a certainty. Due to this
unfortunate series of events, often Dr. Flor and her colleagues have to reach out once again or
even in some cases go out to the vineyards to help these growers identify these pests and by
that time it can be too late.
With these concerns and careful consideration we have narrowed Dr. Flor’s needs into four
main sub categories that we would like to address. First off there is a need for streamlining the
correct information to Dr. Flor. Rather than emails that can potentially get lost over time there
needs to be a centralised system to gather the relevant information. Secondly, there needs to
be a way that assists in pest identification with as minimal human input into the discussion as possible. This is because the higher the human input the more uncertainty that remains. Thirdly,
the system should be easily accessible to multiple growers. This is because in order to properly
track the spread of these pests it needs to be scalable and usable by as many individuals as
possible. Lastly, whatever we design should be made so that growers can use it while in the
field. It would defeat the point of making a streamlined identification system if they still had
to take the time to go back to their office or home to get relevant information. Hence, overall
there is a need for a mobile system that assists growers with correctly identifying pests and
communicating with Dr. Flor.</p>

        <a class="text-lg font-bold sm:text-xl md:text-2xl">What is a SpottedLanternfly?</a>
        <p class="text-m text-black text-left">A Spotted Lanternfly is an insect known as a planthopper that is 
      originally native to parts of China and Vietnam. It has invasively spread to Japan, South Korea, and the United States of
      America. This insects preferred host plant is known as the tree of heaven, but in the United States it affects agricultural 
      products such as soybeans, grapes, stone fruits, and varieties of apples. This causes it to be a priority concern as it is directly 
      affection our food supply chain and hindering farmers livelyhoods. If you find one or a colony of eggs please take action to eradicate the 
      further spread of this insect.</p>

        <a class="text-lg font-bold sm:text-xl md:text-2xl">What is a GrapeBerry Moth?</a>
        <p class="text-m text-black text-left">The Grape Berry Moth otherwise known as the vine moth is another insect that heavily impacts the agriculture industry as a whole.
        Primarily it feasts upon grapes in vineyards and is very hard to detect. They are native to Europe, China, India, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and the Russian far east. 
        However, they have made their way to the United States of America and have begun to become a problem here as well.</p>
